== Syntax

The Anypoint Platform CLI command set has the following syntax:

[source,console]
----
$ anypoint-cli-v4 [command] [options]
----

If you run a command and there is an error, the application exits and returns a description of the issue.

NOTE: You can write all commands separated by spaces or colons. For example: `runtime-mgr:application:list` can also be `runtime-mgr application list`.
