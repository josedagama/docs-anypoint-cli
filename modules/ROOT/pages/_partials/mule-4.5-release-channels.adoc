Starting with Mule 4.5, MuleSoft introduces two new release channels, Edge and Long-term Support (LTS). The Mule runtime versioning schema for the new release channels is:
+
_Major[numeric] . Minor[numeric] . Patch[numeric] : Build[numeric] Channel[e for edge, nothing for LTS]_
+
Some examples of these values are: `4.6.0:1e` for Edge, and `4.6.0:1` for LTS.
