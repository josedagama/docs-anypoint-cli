= Composer Documentation Set

Composer documentation is designed to be built with both link:https://github.com/mulesoft/docs-site-comity[comity] and antora.

== Comity
The documentation that is built with comity is located in the salesforce subdirectory.  It follows a less complex structure than antora projects.

[cols=2*, options=header]
|===
|what
|where

|AsciiDoc files
|`<language>/src/docs`

|Images
|`<language>src/docs/images`

|Share only content
|`<language>src/docs/includes`
|===

where `<language>` is either `en` for English or `jp` for Japanese.

The build is controlled by a playbook maintained in comity.

== Antora
The antora documentation structure matches the rest of Mulesoft's documentation sets
with the exception being the content is stored within a directory signifying the language.
As such, when building, the playbook must include a `start_paths` key and value.
